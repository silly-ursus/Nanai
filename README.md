A few months ago I ran into a [Twitter thread about an epileptic young woman on a train.](https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/strangers-train-epileptic-seizure-how-to-help-viral-twitter-thread/261003) I'd already been tossing around the idea of making a self-care app, something to cheer a person up on those days that are a little rough around the edges; reading that Twitter account made me sit back and rethink my goal for this app.

I still want it to be sweet and cute at heart, but it would be nice to have something with more functionality in a person's everyday life. Especially in cases where a person might have a disability that isn't particularly easy to talk about.

I'm in it for the long road with this one. We'll see where it goes!
